How do you accept command-line arguments?
  - I used $1, this represents the first argument. This can 
    also be extrapulated out to other arguments: $2, $3, etc.


What other programs did you use to complete this assignment?
  - I used stat, numfmt, file, cut, and echo. 

    stat: prints statistics
    numfmt: formats the stat to be human readable
    file: prints mime type when provided --mime-type
    cut: cuts out unnecessary parts of a str
    echo: print statement
